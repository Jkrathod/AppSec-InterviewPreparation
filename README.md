# AppSec-InterviewPreparation

The purpose of this document is to help security folks prepare for common security interview questions and answers. 
Lot of materials only include questions and doesnt include answers. Hence i compiled the resources together. 
The code review section is especially useful for folks doing code review not just preparing for interviews. 

The repo is divided in few sections to focus on different areas as below:
#### Basic security questions [here](https://github.com/Jkrathod/AppSec-InterviewPreparation/blob/main/Common_Security_Questions.md) 
#### Code review questions [here](https://github.com/Jkrathod/AppSec-InterviewPreparation/blob/master/code_review/README.md)
#### Coding questions [here](https://github.com/Jkrathod/AppSec-InterviewPreparation/blob/master/Coding/README.md)
#### AWS Security questions [here](https://github.com/Jkrathod/AppSec-InterviewPreparation/blob/master/AWS_Security_Questions.md)
#### Non-technical/Leadership interview questions [here](https://github.com/Jkrathod/AppSec-InterviewPreparation/blob/master/Leadership_Questions.md)
